## Resources
### Julia resources
Are you new to [Julia](https://julialang.org)? [Download the latest version](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and checkout the Julia [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) and [tutorials](https://julialang.org/learning/) to get started. If you don't want to run Julia locally, then checkout [JuliaBox, it's a hosted alternative in the cloud](https://juliabox.com).

### GitHub resources
Never used [GitHub](https://github.com) before? Checkout out the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com), the [GitHub tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/githubguides) or the [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) for help getting started.

### Biological databases and other resources
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) is an online literature database holding research articles and books.
PubMed holds more than 29 million citations for biomedical literature from [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html),
life science journals, and [online books](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/). 
* [Bionumbers](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx) is a literature database which can be searched for useful quantitative numbers, e.g., [how many Ribosomes are there in an _Escherichia coli_ cell ?](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx?trm=ribosomes+in+E.+coli)
* [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp) is a metabolic reaction database with reaction information for several important organisms.
* [BRENDA](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org) is an enzyme kinetics database that holds a collection of experimentally measured kinetic parameter values.
* [eQuilibrator](http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il) is a thermodynamics database that can be used to calculate the [Gibbs energy of formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gibbs_free_energy_of_formation), and the [Gibbs energy of reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy#Gibbs_free_energy_of_reactions) for metabolic reactions.  
* [RegulonDB](http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx) is a [transcription factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor) database that holds both experimentally and computationally derived regulatory networks primarily in [_Escherichia  coli_ K-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_in_molecular_biology#K-12).
* [The Palsson group](http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Researchers/Palsson) at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu) is a great resource that we'll use throughout the course. Checkout the on-line [SYSTEMS BIOLOGY: Constraint-based Reconstruction and Analysis lectures](http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Publications/Books/SB1-2LectureSlides).
